## Today is 2025-05-20

Why do this demons follow me everywhere! If I fail they come closer, but they are always persistent. They laugh everytime you fail. Why is this a never ending battle.
I mean at least I have to fight them instead of do nothing. Nothingness is more scary.
You know what I have the options to AURA farm this demons. Hahhahahah. And I will do just that!

Honesly no matter how you feel you should keep moving forward and I will keep moving forward. I have to be calm, maintained and hard worker.
You know there are so many paths to take in this world and so many have probably taken better paths, but no matter what demons follow them to.
Some just never see them or want to realize they exits so they just live simple lifes. Some are medioker some are calm and peaceful.

Yeah this world is pretty interesting.

Thats enough for today. Thank you for reading! Hope you stay strong and learn hard.
