## Today is 2025-06-06

You know man. To see the sun in th morning is nothing more that what you should desire.
Isoloation and loniness is hard. 
We human creatures never get to learn do we.
You know I never thought how important to have someone to give your heart to is.
Well sometimes I have no one to give it to, but from now on I will give it to the world.
To the sun in the morning.
