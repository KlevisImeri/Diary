<h2>Today is 2025-06-01</h2>
<p>I always come to this diary when I guess not fealing okay, but today I fell nothing. Today I was a nice day.
One of my friends, her family has a caffe and it was the caffe anniversary opening. So I kind of went and said a happy thing.
But that is not the main point. The main point is that I dont rally think anything. Plus I think I am going to cut off
all social media. I mean I only used youtube, but I just got tired of it also. So i was thinking, what do people what have done
everything that they wanted do. Then there is nothing what do you do. Can you do nothing. Like I don't want to do anything.
It's funny cause I always feel like this its like, I just have anythgin better to do and nothgin suprices me. I mean I have to
study for things but its not that I am geting exited to do that, but I am not getting said or angry either. It just I can do it
or I can not do it. I don't know what to do about this. This is not good. Peple should feel some exitimetn in their life no.
Like I want to feel tha today I can be and tomorrow I may not survive. It's funny how we biological being on earth are driven
by fear and driven by los. I think the fear of dying makes being to live. But what if they just aren't scare of death anymore
what do they do. How do they find their purpose. I guess you predesossors may have analyzed all our brain and came up with the
full mapping our brain and you can understand every emotion and how they are generated and maybe you can understand how to counter
it. Maybe you even understand how far our will can go no. Maybe doing nothing is a cure to our brain? I guess you intellegent
spicies can answer this.</p>
<p>I wonder if in the future have we become just lab rates or somehow our brain has survive. Also what makes us? Like how do we
become consciencies about this world, what a about a plain rock, does it exibit features like us. But when i think about it
we are nothgin more then a phenomen of small thing interection to create intercreate thing. Like the complexit coming out of
small axioms. I genuily think we are nothign more. Like i think also a rock is conciencies, but for a rock it is the abilit
of the molecules to ack together and shkriung and expand together while for us this proces is just more complex.</p>
<p>Maybe we can just say that conciencies its just "a measuer of complexity of the emerging interactions". By Interactions I
just mean here the most probable thing to happen. For exmple it was the most probalby that my brain conencts the sentece this
way. The small interaction betwen our barin cells create emerging interactions which are more probably to happen. Its like
the differnce between micor and macor economis or the differnce bettwen a person actions and the whole society.</p>
<p>I wandor what do you species in ther future thing, what have come to realize. Where you about to understan yourselfs?
Here I will leave some blacnk space for you to answer: ______________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>Isn't it cool you are interacting with a person from 2025.</p>
<p>One more think I wanted to talk about is that the quote I came up.
"To beat everything you should be able to do nothing."
What i mean by this is that they when brain and boddy becomes numb. You should be able to do nothing. You should bord yourself.
Bordem is key to many things.</p>
<p>What I should not forget is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always fight strong.</li>
<li>To beat yourbrain is to bord itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay now everytime I start this diary I should use this this what I should never forget part.
Okay thank you for today fonks and see you another day.</p>
