  <h2>Today is 2025-05-06</h2>
<p>I did an interview today. It was very nice. The only problem I actually had is that while I was speaking I forgot what the questions was.
But it is what it is. We have to move one with life.
I am actually writting this because I also have a big exam tomorrow and I was fealing a bit stressed.
I hope it goes well.
I mean I passed the interview I think pretty well with flying colorls, but I feel so stressed for no reasons.
I never felt like this.
Hahahaha.
Well Im gonna go and study now.</p>
