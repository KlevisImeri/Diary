  <h2>Today is 2025-06-09</h2>
<p>You know what do I fight for?
What is my end goal, is there one?
I want to become nothing and everything.
A king free to fly but changed to his throne.
A god that rules everything but owns nothing.
I want to become me.</p>
<p>Just Nothing
Nothing
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING</p>
<p>Is suffering a curse or a gift?
Why do we people forget?</p>
